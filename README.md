Inspiration
For the 2025 version of the Climate Change-Maker Hackathon, our team wanted to create an engaging and educational experience to raise awareness about environmental issues. We were inspired by the need to teach people who just want to have a fun time about the impact of human actions on nature and how small changes can make a big difference. Gamification felt like the perfect approach to make learning fun, interactive and cause an impression on people

What Does It Do?
Eco Quiz is a webpage featuring five little interactive games focused on different environmental topics:

• Vehicles: A simulation of a 10 km car ride that showcases the impact on the environment of the ride on a kilometer by kilometer basis.

• Garbage: A small quiz with questions pertaining to recycling and waste management, with personalized recommendations on how to reduce contamination.

• Water: Responsible water usage during bath time.

• Plants: The ecological importance of plants and their role in the ecosystem.

• Lighbulbs: The impact of energy consumption depending on your type and amount of light-bulbs

How We Built It
We developed Eco Quiz using:

• HTML to structure the webpage.

• CSS to create an appealing design.

• JavaScript to handle quiz functionality, user interactions, and score tracking.

• Flask for all the back-end functionalities and hosting purposes.

• Git for collaboration and teamwork purposes.

Challenges
During development, we faced a few challenges, including:

• Ensuring the quizzes worked correctly and displayed feedback dynamically.

• Making the design visually appealing and user-friendly.

• Debugging JavaScript functionalities.

• Figuring out how to host a Flask web application.

• Figuring out the file structure of the project.

Accomplishments
We are proud of:

• Successfully creating a functional and interactive webpage.

• Designing a visually appealing layout that is easy to navigate.

• Implementing JavaScript and Flask to enhance user interaction and engagement.

• Learning new coding techniques and improving our teamwork skills.

• Deploying the website with Render.

What We Learned
This project taught us valuable lessons, including:

• How to use JavaScript for a wide variety of interactive web elements.

• How to host a Flask web application with Render

• How to collaborate effectively as a team using the Git and Github technologies

• The significance of environmental awareness.

What’s Next?
We plan to improve and expand Eco Quiz by:

• Adding more fun little games on different environmental topics.

• Enhancing the design of the current games with animations and better UI elements.
